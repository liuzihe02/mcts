# Monte Carlo Tree Search
This is a minimal implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This repo is heavily inspired by [int8's repo](https://github.com/int8/monte-carlo-tree-search) and [qpwo's repo](https://gist.github.com/qpwo/c538c6f73727e254fdc7fab81024f6e1), and captures elements from both.
